<h4><em>
<p>This horn-shaped peak is one of the highest mountains the Alps. About 3000 climbers summit the Matterhorn per year. In the summer, up to 150 climbers can attempt an ascent each day.
The Swiss-German name for the peak comes from the words Matte meaning ‘meadow’ and horn meaning ‘peak’. It is called Monte Cervino in Italian or Mont Cervin in French.
The Matterhorn first appeared on the famous Toblerone packaging in 1960. Before this, an eagle was the main symbol. Have you spotted the bear in the Matterhorn image on Toblerone.
 This is a reference to Bern, where Theodor Tobler first invented the bar.</p> </em></h4>
